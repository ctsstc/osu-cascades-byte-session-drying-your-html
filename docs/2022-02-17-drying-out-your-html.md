# DRYing out your HTML with React and Next JS

## What is Next JS?

> Next.js gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. No config needed.

## What is React?

## Start a Next JS project

```shell
npx create-next-app@latest
npx create-next-app@latest --ts --use-npm
byte-session-drying-your-html
```

## Identify:

- Header
- Body
- Footer

## Create a Page Component

## Identify a new redundancy: Manufacturers

## Introduce:

- Components
- Properties
- Special property: children property
- Creating an instance of a component and attributes
  - Attributes are strings
  - They can evaluate though attr={val}

## Styling:

- Inline styles
- Module styling
- Tailwind - the "write no css library"

## Dynamic URLs

- Display only 1 manufacturer

## Probably don't have time but:

- Highlighting navigation using useRouter hook
- Adding new motorcycles into our data collection
- Formik: npm install formik

## Maybe?

- Types
  - Proptype
  - Typescript
  - Flow?!??
